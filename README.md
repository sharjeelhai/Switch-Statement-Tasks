ðŸ“Œ Program 1: Bank Account Menu (Switch Statement)

This program simulates a simple text-based bank account menu using Java.
It displays four options to the user:

View Balance

Deposit

Withdraw

Exit

The program takes an integer input from the user and executes the corresponding action using a switch statement. If the user enters an invalid option, it shows an error message.

Key Concepts Used:

Scanner class for user input

switch statement for menu selection

Basic console interaction

This program is useful for practicing menu-driven applications and understanding how to handle user choices with conditional branching.

ðŸ“Œ Program 2: Basic Calculator (Single Operation)

This program is a simple calculator in Java that performs a single arithmetic operation on two numbers.
It works in the following steps:

Asks the user to enter two numbers.

Prompts the user to choose an operation (+, -, *, /).

Uses a switch statement to perform the chosen calculation.

Displays the result, or an error message if division by zero is attempted or if the operator is invalid.

Key Concepts Used:

Scanner class for input

switch statement for operator selection

Arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)

Error handling for invalid input and division by zero

This project is ideal for learning how to take multiple inputs, use operators in Java, and apply conditional logic in real-world style applications.
